I am glad you are interested in knowing more about the game! 
The game was developed by the student Francisco Adauto Canuto 
Dorta Filho, of the discipline Object Oriented Programming of
the Computer Science course of the University of Fortaleza (Unifor).
With the development of the game we intend to practice and exercise
the teachings learned in the classroom, such as the use of classes,
hierarchy, abstraction, and everything related to the subject. In the
SuperBattle game, you will have the possibility to choose between 3
characters. With 6 rounds, the winner is the one who survives to the
end of the game or the one who has more life in the final battle.
That's it :)
